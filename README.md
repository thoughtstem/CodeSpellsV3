## A Brief History of Magic

In the beginning, there was CodeSpells V1

(We do not speak of this one.)

Then, there was (and is) CodeSpells V2. [You can get this one on Steam now](http://store.steampowered.com/app/324190/CodeSpells/)

Now there is CodeSpells V3.  We don't really know what it will become -- except that it'll be awesome.  It's a project driven by the community.  (The original creators of CodeSpells fully support this endeavor.)
